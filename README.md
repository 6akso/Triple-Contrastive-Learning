Overview

This repository contains the complete code for the paper "Triple Contrastive Learning Representation Boosting for Supervised Multiclass Tasks". You can directly run the code to achieve the reported results. Additionally, the repository includes pre-trained models for the baseline method (CE+SCL) and our proposed method (TSI-CL).

Code Structure and Updates

All experiments in the paper were completed a year ago, and during that period, the code was somewhat complex. To improve usability and maintainability, we have reorganized the code for clarity. While we ensured that the code ran correctly on our devices before submission, please note that some issues may have arisen due to code restructuring. If you encounter any errors while running the code, feel free to contact us, and we will assist in resolving them.

Applying TSCL to Other Domains

In theory, the Triple Supervised Contrastive Learning (TSCL) idea is applicable to any algorithmic that utilizes supervised contrastive learning. If you wish to extend TSCL to other domains, you only need to make minor modifications to the loss function interface of TSCL.
