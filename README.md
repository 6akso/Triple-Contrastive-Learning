Overview

This repository contains the complete code for the paper 'Triple Contrastive Learning Representation Boosting for Supervised Multiclass Tasks.' You can run the code directly to achieve good results.

Code Structure and Updates

Most of the experiments were completed a year ago. During this period, the code was relatively complex. To improve usability and maintainability, we have reorganized the code for better clarity. While we ensured that the code ran correctly on our devices before submission, some issues may have arisen due to the code restructuring. If you encounter any errors while running the code, please feel free to contact us, and we will assist in resolving them.

Applying TSCL to Other Domains

In theory, the Triple Supervised Contrastive Learning (TSCL) idea is applicable to any algorithmic that utilizes supervised contrastive learning. If you wish to extend TSCL to other domains, you only need to make minor modifications to the loss function interface of TSCL.
