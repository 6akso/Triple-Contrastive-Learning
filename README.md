##This is the complete code for the paper "Triple Contrastive Learning Representation Boosting for Supervised Multiclass Tasks" . You can run the code directly to achieve good results. I have also uploaded models trained with the baseline CE+SCL and our improved method TSI-CL.

##Since all the experiments mentioned in the paper were completed a year ago, and the code was overly complex during the experiments, I have reorganized it. However, this might also introduce some errors. Although we ensured the code ran correctly on our devices before submission, if you encounter any errors while running the code, please contact us to resolve them together.

##SIn theory, our TSCL is applicable to any algorithmic framework that uses supervised contrastive learning. If you want to apply our TSCL to other domains, you only need to make slight modifications to the loss function interface of TSC
